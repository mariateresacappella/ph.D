    <div class="abstract-text">The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) 2023–2027 introduces stringent sustainability requirements, reshaping land use and influencing crop planning and economic outcomes for European farmers. This study examines the impact of recent CAP reforms on farmland allocation and related implications on farm profitability, in a sample of highly specialized cereal farms located in intensive agricultural areas of Northern Italy. Using Integer Linear Programming models, we simulate farmers’ decision-making under different CAP frameworks, considering 2014–2020, 2021–2023, and 2023–2027 environmental constraints changes. Results highlight a shift in crop distribution, with reductions in staple cereals like maize and wheat and increases in legumes, soy, and industrial crops, aligning with biodiversity and soil health goals. These transitions, however, can lead to reduced farm income, particularly in high-output systems, where profit margins are strongly tied to cereal production. While the findings are specific to a well-defined farming context, they underscore the broader tension between ecological targets and economic viability. The study also considers policy adaptations introduced in response to farmer protests, suggesting that greater flexibility and support mechanisms are critical to achieving sustainability without undermining farm resilience.</div>

    <button class="toggle-abstract">Show Abstract</button>
    <div class="abstract-text">This study evaluates the impact of nitrogen recommendations provided by a Decision Support System (DSS) on soft wheat production and technical efficiency in specialized Italian cereal farms. Employing a Stochastic Frontier Analysis, the research evaluates the relationship between adherence to DSS recommendations and farm performance. The analysis relies on real farm data from the Barilla Farming platform, agrarian year 2022/2023, covering 487 farms and 1,664 fields, including suggested and actual nitrogen applications and observed yields. Findings indicate that compliance with DSS recommendations enhances productivity and efficiency, particularly for medium and large farms, whereas deviations, especially over-application, reduce efficiency with potential increase of costs and environmental risks. Notably, small farms maintain efficiency despite lower nitrogen applications, indicating the need for tailored DSS calibration. Results highlight the importance of site-specific nitrogen management strategies to optimize both economic and environmental outcomes. While promoting DSS adoption is essential, our findings suggest that ensuring farmers' compliance with DSS recommendations is equally—if not more—critical to realizing its full benefits. Policymakers and extension services should not only encourage the uptake of DSS but also focus on strategies that enhance farmers' adherence to recommended practices. Additionally, ensuring the adaptability of DSS to different farm structures is key to maximizing its impact across varying production scales.</div>

    <div class="abstract-text">This study examines behavioral and organizational factors influencing farmers’ acceptance of digital farming technologies and how governance mechanisms in hybrid agri-food chains shape innovation. Focusing on the Italian processed tomato supply chain, it analyses how Producer Organizations (POs) combine technical, contractual, and relational governance to foster Decision Support Systems (DSS) adoption. Drawing on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and supply chain governance theory, the study integrates two complementary data sources: (i) survey data from 260 tomato producers, distinguishing DSS users and non-users, analysed through two parallel structural equation models evaluating the effects of usefulness, ease of use, environment, and support quality on adoption behaviour; and (ii) a structured analysis of existing contracts and farmers’ preferred contractual clauses, assessing how hybrid governance instruments, minimum price guarantees, quality premiums, multiannual commitments, and technology-support measures, relate to digital adoption pathways. Results reveal clear asymmetries between adopters and non-adopters. For non-users, adoption intention is driven by perceived support and peer influence, whereas for users, ease of use and attitude explain continued utilization. Across both groups, PO-provided support enhances perceived ease of use, confirming the centrality of relational and institutional enablers. Contractual preferences also diverge, non-users prioritize minimum-price guarantees, while users favour quality-based incentives, multiannual commitments, and innovation-oriented clauses. The study bridges behavioural adoption models with contractual and relational governance mechanisms, showing that digital transition in agriculture arises from the interaction between individual perceptions and coordinated supply chain arrangements. It advances the integration of TAM with SCM theory, offering actionable insights for designing enabling environments, differentiated contractual bundles, and support systems that align digitalization with farmers’ heterogeneous risk profile </div>

    <div class="abstract-text">The present study critically examines whether current EU regulatory efforts to curb greenwashing, specifically Directive (EU) 2024/825, adequately address the perceptual biases generated by visual cues. The analysis explores how visual and textual elements on food packaging jointly shape consumers’ perceptions of product sustainability, with specific attention to the color green and the type of environmental claim (compliant Vs. vague). A nationally representative sample of 1,004 Italian responsible of household food purchasing participated in a Best–Worst Scaling (BWS) evaluation. Respondents evaluated seven food categories (e.g., pasta, tomato sauce, tuna) differing in packaging color and sustainability claims. Psychographic constructs such as environmental concern, trust in the food system, and consumer expertise were also measured to explain preference heterogeneity. Results show that green-colored packaging systematically enhances perceived sustainability, even when claims are vague or non-compliant. Regulation-compliant claims are preferred overall, yet the green color amplifies perceived environmental friendliness independently of textual accuracy. The color effect persists across product categories but weakens or reverses for culturally emblematic products such as pasta and tomato sauce, where authenticity and familiarity shape perception. Latent class analysis revealed limited heterogeneity, suggesting that heuristic reliance on green cues is widespread rather than segment-specific. The study integrates behavioral and policy perspectives to demonstrate that visual heuristics can undermine regulatory efforts against greenwashing. Findings highlight the need to complement textual regulation with behavioral insights and visual communication guidelines, combining stricter marketing oversight with consumer education to enhance critical interpretation of sustainability cues.</div>

    <button class="toggle-abstract">Show Abstract</button>
    <div class="abstract-text">Mediterranean forest ecosystems are increasingly threatened by climate change, land abandonment, and socio-economic pressures. Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes have been proposed as innovative tools to support their conservation. This study explores residents’ willingness to pay (WTP) to contribute to such a scheme, using cork oak forests as a representative case. The present study analyses whether residents (n = 268) of the Golfo di Policastro area (Sothern Italy) are willing to contribute to the conservation of these endangered ecosystems through an annual donation. Additionally, the impact of scientific and popularized information on residents’ WTP is explored together with the main drivers behind individuals’ willingness to contribute for the conservation of cork oak forests. Results show that 45.52% of the respondents were willing to contribute with an average WTP of 26.02 €/year (SD = 21.31). Furthermore, participants exposed to scientific information revealed a more marked increase in their average WTP (32.85 €/year) than those who received populararized information. Findings also prove that perceptions of importance of protection of cork oak forests, knowledge about other uses of cork oak trees, pro-environmental behaviors, and financial satisfaction level are positively associated with the likelihood of being willing to pay. Conversely, perceptions of natural resources availability were negatively associated with the probability to contribute. These insights provide implications for the design of PES schemes across Mediterranean forest landscapes.</div>
